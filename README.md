The plan is that this will become an all-in-one install script for easy install of linux, along side that
git repos can be clone and installed, addons and themes can be installed and backgrounds can be downloaded.

Not working
Git only reads first git repo in conf
wget does not wait for download to finish
customApplications do not execute properly yet
